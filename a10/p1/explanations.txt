a) If we comment out "using namespace std" the program won't compile. There would be an error like "cout, endl, cin, string was not declared in the scope", which means we have to include std::cout, std::endl, std::cin, std::__cxx11::string in our program each case we want to use the std library functions.


b) If we remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the methods, there'd be the following error "‘name’ was not declared in this scope", and in order for it to work we need to state the function's class.
